Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they adhe answer in any d up to target.  
You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.  You can return torder.     

Example 1:  Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9 Output: [0,1] Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].
